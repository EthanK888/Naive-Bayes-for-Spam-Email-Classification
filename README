Spam email classification using Naive Bayes
Following paper "Detecting Email Spam with NLP: A Machine Learning Approach"
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10486769

This paper only had code for the preprocessing, which is processText function in my code. I only made 1 small change to this function, which was rejoining the string together for the pandas dataframe.
All other code is created by me, with help from online sources of course since I had no idea how to do any of this beforehand.

Ensure dependencies are installed:
pip install pandas nltk scikit-learn matplotlib numpy

To run the code, ensure that spam.csv is in the parent directory of spamclassifier.py. Then, assuming you're in the code directory, run with the following command:
python spamclassifier.py

It will ask for a seed input for the split randomization. I used 4 as the seed, so input that to reproduce my results. Everything else runs automatically, with the exception of the precision-recall curve which only appears when you close the confusion matrix and ROC curve windows.
